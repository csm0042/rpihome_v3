Known issues:
1)  Despite update message being sent to database AND database updating in processed field, still getting delayed,
    repeat commands going out to the wemo service from the auto service
2)  Nothing currently in-place to generate log status update (LSU) messages.  This used to work, need to look at an old revision and see why
    this stopped working
3)  "try" part of handle_msg_out in the helpers/message_handlers.py is too broad and it's impossible to tell from log what message it errors 
    out on when a message fails to send.
